	<h3>Final Project, Object-Oriented and Advanced Programming</h3>
	<p>Solo Course Project</p>
</div>

**An extensive exercise in object-oriented design and dive into modern C++ features. I used patterns such as Model-View-Controller, composite, aggregation, static Singleton, and multiple inheritance, and learned the inner workings of and relied on features such as templates and smart pointers for cleaner, maintainable code. Code sample available upon request.**

**This project was the culmination of a semester in one of the University of Michigan's most notoriously difficult undergraduate courses, in which I earned an A.**
